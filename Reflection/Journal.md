Choosing a subject to explore from the Twitter thread: Early Caribbean Digital Archives (ECDA)
After exploring the twitter thread, I found many interesting subjects to explore. The one that caught my eye was ECDA because it
had a picture of an old house under construction attached to it. For some reeason, this picture induced an emotional/nostalgic 
reaction for me. Which makes sense because I am a very visual person, hence my sense of sight is the most easily stimulated. 
From this experience, I learned that archives should have more images, rather than just text, because I would never read a very
long document if it didn't have any images in it. 
After exploring the ECDA website, I learned about the mission to decolonize Caribbean history and how they used the remix and 
re-assembly to recount stories that were authored by slaves and placing them parallel to stories that were authored by 
slave owners to provide a full view of Caribbean history. This experience was very interesting and motivated me to continue the
next task for this week.
