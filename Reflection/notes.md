Early Caribbean Digital Archive (ECDA)
Archives have biases, human biases
Knowledge and non-knowledge are decided by individuals
Caribbean archives are deeply entwined with colonial European influence
Digital archives are a chance to re-archive biased/Eurocentric Caribbean archives
Digital archives creates a chance for a community of creators to review, question, disrupt, and revise the inaccruacies 
that exist within the countries'/communities' written history
Digital archives are coded material and are not as permanent as paper archives, which makes them flexible to implementing 
new historical discoveries within them, as history is mutable. For example, in most of human hisotry we believe the Earth 
to be the centre of the universe instead of the sun. 
Analogue texts are a chance to study digital construction of history 
ECDA places stories of similiar timeline, stories from the perspectives of slaves and putting them parallel to well-known books
about that time period that were written by colonial authors. This creates the chance to diversify the perspectives of 
historical events and de-centralizing the elite view of them.
ECDA aims to answer questions such as: Did enslaved people from the early Caribbean write slave narratives? Where can I learn 
about early Caribbean history? How are native people represented in the colonial archives? One of the techniques they use to 
answer these questions is called remix and reassembly, which is what I described earlier.
